    <h1>Nidhi Bendre</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Nidhi and I am a second year student at Northeastern University studying data science and health science. I am 
        currently working as a teaching assistant for DS2000 (intro to python programming) and last semester I was a TA for CS1800 (discrete 
        structures). I am also a part of data club and Vital Northeastern here on campus. In my free time I like to read, do nails, and spend
        time with my friends. My academic interests include machine learning, digital health solutions, and biostatistics.
